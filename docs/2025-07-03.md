## 001 No reading time

Reading time doesn’t mean much: a blog is either interesting, or too long. The scrollbar is a better indicator than reading time.

## 002 No improved spacing around en/em dash

In Dutch, the rules are different than in English, so everything is solved by using the right spaces/characters in the source text. Also, Recursive (the current choice of font for this website) has lousy rendering for the em dash: it’s way too narrow. Third, the technical solution would be using html entities for spacing (like `&emsp14`, [see here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8515365/are-there-other-whitespace-codes-like-nbsp-for-half-spaces-em-spaces-en-space)) which means I have to write a rehype plugin instead of a remark one, and I don’t like that. So.
