**Stuff I have that I really, really like and you would too. A lot of text should be here because otherwsie the intro is just a line of text**

## UE Wonderboom

I bought a black UE Wonderboom 2 a couple of years ago and every time, it beats the competetion by a landslide. Obviously there are larger and more expensive BT speakers with better sound, but there’s a reason it’s always on top of the buying guides. Highly, highly recommended

## Aer Slim Pouch

After trying several (tech) pouches, the Aer absolutely delivers. Great build quality, good size, organisation options, elegant looks without being flashy or too technical. Good stuff

## Sony MDR-7506 headphones

Had them for years, they’re wired and don’t have any buttons, but they are very comfortable and as far as I'm concerned the sound is great.
