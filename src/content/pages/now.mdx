## Code

- Rebuilt this website with Astro + CF Pages instead of hardcoded HTML + AWS S3
- Charmed by [Love2d](https://love2d.org/) and Lua, but haven’t started anything yet

## Home

- Going on vacation soon, including a week solo camping with 3 kids
- 2 birthdays coming up
- Yard work!

## Workout

- Ran 10km last month, which was fun. Haven’t been able to work out nor run recently but will get back to it
- Son is going to start Jiu Jitsu, which I am excited about for myself as well. Might try that out some time

## Games, TV, Music

- Started a second run of The Last of Us Part II on PS5, with lower difficulty setting. But the lower difficulty makes it less enjoyable, tbh
- Recently saw Bombshell and BlackkKlansman; liked the former, the latter less
- The Boys S4 was fun
