## Two sentence horror

- **I can vividly remember** the childhood nightmares of wolves chasing me in the dark, the low growl and clack of jaws snapping at my throat. As the camp fire dies out and scores of yellow eyes close in from the treeline, I realise my night terrors were visions of my death.
- **I woke up to loud pinging** and a blur of flickering red and orange lights, a metallic taste in my mouth and scorching heat at my legs. Through the noise I heard the boy sobbing in the back seat: “Reload from checkpoint Daddy, reload from checkpoint!”
